- 👋 Hi, I’m @DonLoRa
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Custom/DIY Image Capture & Lighting systems for Photography, also quite generally interested in regenerative farming/sustainability/dataMonitoring&ControlSystems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Absolute Newbie to coding, and Heltec LoRa systems
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... May need advice on entry level coding, e.g Controlling ICSE014a (8x)Relay board Via UART Serial from HelTec AB02A (CubeCell LoRa Development Board), also controlling single relays via GPIO pins, also using these AB02A units to be tranceivers (EACH unit could Send AND Receive to achieve a 'mesh' network for better transmission) Also, Attaching Rotary switch as signal into AB02A to Control receiver/tranceiver signal out at another AB02A ouputing to ICSE014a (for, as above via UART serial or similar) Knowing existing free coding to use I would be super grateful.
