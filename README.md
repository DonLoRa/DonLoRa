- 👋 Hi, I’m @DonLoRa
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Custom/DIY Image Capture & Lighting systems for Photography, also quite generalyy interested in regenerative farming/sustainability/dataMonitoring&COntrolSystems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Absolute Newbie to coding, and Heltec LoRa systems
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... May need advice on entry level coding, e.g Controlling ICSE014a (8x)Relay board Via UART Serial from HelTec AB02A (CubeCell LoRa Development Board), also controlling single relays via GPIO pins, also using these AB02A units to be tranceivers (Send AND Receive to achieve a 'mesh' network for better transmission) Attach Rotary switch as signal into AB02A to Control receiver/tranceiver signal out at ICSE014a
